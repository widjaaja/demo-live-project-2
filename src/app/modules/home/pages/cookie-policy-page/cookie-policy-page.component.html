            <h6>Use of Cookies</h6>
            <p>
            The SQL Mantra Tools Website use "cookies" to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Webpage server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
            </p>
            <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalise SQL Mantra Tools pages, or register with the SQL Mantra Tools site or services, a cookie helps SQL Mantra Tools to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same SQL Mantra Tools Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the SQL Mantra Tools features that you customised.</p>
            <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the SQL Mantra Tools services or Web sites you visit.</p>
