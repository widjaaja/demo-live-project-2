          <p class="width-95">
            In a very busy and big OLTP database such as Dynamics NAV, Dynamics AX, and Business Central database data is quite often unevenly
            distributed. Typically 90% of the data will be held in10% of the tables and quite often these tables are very active with lots of inserts, updates,
            deletes and reads operations performed on them. Due to these characteristic, vast majority of the index rebuilding strategies normally used in
            the wider SQL communities will not work to keep the index is a healthy state. SQL Mantra Tools has come up with a unique index maintenance
            strategy specifically geared towered such busy and big OLTP databases. Even though it geared towards busy and big OLTP database, it will
            equally work well for a verity of database and work loads such as very small databases, web backend database to BI databases. Some of it’s
            key features can be found below. Without proper index maintenance, performance will suffer in long run. Our maintenance strategy is
            “prevention is better than cure”. Our unique index maintenance package will proactively maintain indexes and will take care of routine
            maintenance such as Backups, Checking database for errors and many more with automated alerting feature giving organisation piece of
            mind.

                The following are some of the key features of “set and forget” index maintenance module.

            <ul class="list-style-16">
              <li  class="success">Only rebuild index which are fragmented more than 5% on a daily basis. The rest of the index will be rebuilt proactively in a round robin fashion covering different portions of database each day.</li>
              <li  class="success">Routine will not Reorganise index as the Reorganise process is single threaded and will not use parallel operation. Hence the execution is much slower.</li>
              <li  class="success">Options to override index selection / exclusion on each day’s index rebuild load.</li>
              <li  class="success">Fill factor settings are adaptively changed and optimised based on index’s volatility, data type, size and bad page splits.</li>
              <li  class="success">Option to terminate/limit the execution of the re-index after a set time period, so that it will not interfere/block busy/critical process.</li>
              <li  class="success">Option to log the details of re-index process (such as what index detail, start and end time, page split, old and new fill factor, etc…)</li>
              <li  class="success">Ability to re-index using multiple parallel re-index process (only recommended for really large database which has a very good disk system) to reduce the re-index time window. The concurrent re-index sessions will coordinate and share the work load equally among themselves and they make sure they do not block each other by working on different tables and it’s dependent index.</li>
              <li  class="success">Option to rebuild index online (subject to having SQL Enterprise Edition).</li>
              <li  class="success">Option to target re-index process on any database within the same SQL Server instance.</li>
              <li  class="success">If an index is static, it will not be rebuild at all. The routine will prioritise and rebuild index which have the most fragmentation first.</li>
              <li  class="success">If time is limited in a day, option to only re-index badly fragmented index (i.e. more than 5%).</li>
              <li  class="success">While rebuilding index, options to change the recovery model to bulk logged or Simple to minimise the transaction log space usage. Once completed the original recovery model will be restored.</li>
